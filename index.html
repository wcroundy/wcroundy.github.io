                to get my feet wet in the tech industry however I can.  I am interested 
                in coding, web design, hardware development, VLSI design, FPGAs and other 
                tech fields.  I am also interested in SAAS applications, entrepreneurship, 
                business, and general problem solving.  I am creative and enjoy writing 
                and reading both for pleasure and function.  I excel at a host of soft skills 
                paired with technical knowledge, work ethic, and ability to learn quickly.  
            </p>

            <p>I have a proven history of excellence in job performance.  I can be an 
            immediate asset to the company.  My past employers and listed references 
            can attest to my competence as a great employee and individual of character.</p>

            <p>I believe I have the skills, work ethic, and ingenuity to be an 
                asset to any company.  I am willing to consistently arrive on time, 
                stay on task, and meet deadlines.  I enjoy problem solving and can 
                keep a cool head while dealing with difficult or frustrating issues.  
                I am easy going, a hard worker, detail oriented, and I get along with 
                everyone.</p>
            <p>I have gained experience with software engineering and programming in 
                C, C# and C++ throughout the course of my studies.  I am also knowledgeable 
                in circuitry and hardware which is the emphasis of my coursework in the computer 
                engineering program at Utah Valley University.  I am currently a senior in that 
                program.</p>
            <p>I am skilled in the use of computers for the purposes of communication, 
                word processing, spreadsheets, presentations and other business tasks.  
                I am a meticulous individual by nature and assure that things are done 
                correctly and in a timely manner.  I am a self-starter and can stay on 
                task with minimal supervision as well as go the extra mile and see what 
                else needs to be done that may be unassigned.  I work and collaborate 
                well with others.  </p>
             <p>I am a people person.  I am a great listener and my background 
                in customer service and sales is a testament to my social skills.  
                I have been successful in several customer-facing positions and 
                have dealt with consumers and business in my sales efforts.  
                Ecclesiastically, I have had responsibilities that have helped 
                 me become and empathetic individual.  </p>
            <p>On paper, I’m sure I may seem very similar to other candidates.  
                I can however assure that I am a cut above.  I am a hard worker.

                individual of character and utmost honesty.  I am generally a humble 
                person, but I can attest to possessing these qualities.  My refences 
                can attest to the same, they have told me as much as I have worked 
                with them.  Most of all, I will commit to being what my employer
